This will avoid duplicate document numbers being issued into the system.</p>

          <p>Changes to the document will be implemented by the originator as appropriate in accordance with the comments received and forwarded to the QHSE Representative.  
          The revised sections/parts of the draft document shall be indicated by italic bold font.
          The document will also be distributed for comments. The revised draft copies will be re-circulated to those personnel on the original distribution list.</p> 
         <p class="sub_head">Approved Documents</p> 
         <p>Any change to an approved document will be controlled by the QHSE Representative or delegate. A Change Request Note (CRN) will be raised by the QHSE Representative prior to issuing the document for review.</p>  
         <p>Copies of the document being changed may accompany the CRN for clarification.</p> 
         <p>The change request shall be approved by the QHSE Representative after the review has been completed.</p> 
         <p>Responsibility for approval shall lie with the managing director of the company or delegate and the QHSE Representative for the approval of procedural changes.</p> 
         <p>Review of change request(s) shall be required by those functions that performed the original review of the document, i.e. those positions stated on the approval document.</p> 
         <p>The QHSE Representative will distribute the change request to the relevant personnel to review the change.  Following submission of the change request, the request will either be accepted or rejected.</p> 
        <p class="sub_head">Accepted</p>

Obsolete pages, sections or the whole document will be clearly identified "SUPERCEDED" and will depend on the extent of the change. Superseded pages or sections will be filed by the QHSE Representative or Designated Document Controller in the "Superseded File". 
        Change Request Notes (CRN's) will be filed by the QHSE Representative or Designated Document Controller. Issue and distribution of changes to documents will be in accordance with QHSE Management System requirements. Minor changes to pages/sections within a document will require amending the revision number on the page without need to amending the issue letter for the whole document. 
        Changes will be signified by highlighting the change area in the same way as for draft documents, or by a red line in the right hand border. </p>
        <p class="sub_head">Rejected</p> 
        <p>Following rejection of a request, after discussions with the originator when required, the CRN will be filed in the CRN file. The originator of the request will be notified of the rejection by the QHSE Representative and given a copy of the relevant CRN when completed.</p>
